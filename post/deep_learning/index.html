      <p>In machine learning, the role of models is to approximate a mapping using data and, more importantly, generalizing this behavior for unseen instances of the given problem.</p>
<p>On this matter, several strategies within artificial intelligence once had their share of success. In the past these were mainly supported by expert knowledge - either by embedding rigid rules into models or by manually combining input variables and designing more abstract features to mitigate limitations of the settings then used. Conversely, neural networks were able to learn target functions solely based on input data. At that time, their architecture relied on a shallow structure, i.e. using a small number of layers, and their achievements were limited to simple sets of applications.</p>

On the right a similar setting in which the same network fails.<br>Source: <a href="#References">Olah, C. (2016)</a></p>
</div>
<p>As the complexity of applications increase the mentioned approaches tend to fail. A task such as image classification poses a challenge to these methods namely because it is overwhelmingly difficult to combine a large number of low-level features (pixels) to determine a contrasting abstract outcome (object). Alternatively, deep learning is able to better accomplish this task <a href="#References">Bradley (2010, pg. 22)</a>.</p>
<p>Hierarchical learning, deep structured learning, or simply deep learning can be defined as <em>a class of machine learning techniques that exploit many layers of non-linear units</em> (<a href="#References">Deng and Yu (2013, pg. 199)</a>). This better capability is attained by the substantial coupling of non-linear operations whose parameters readapt, gradually approximating the target function thus deriving complex feature hierarchies from low-level inputs.</p>
<img src="./figures/deep_learning_pg6.png" width="60%"/>
<p style="font-size:0.8em;" align="center">Compositional representation of features throughout layers: from pixels to gradients and edges. <br>Source: <a href="#References">Goodfellow et al. (2016, pg. 6)</a></p>
<p>A neural network can progressively synthesize more structured features along the layers, indicating the number of layers as a crucial factor in model design, and as experimental outlines in <a href="#References">He et al. (2015)</a> and <a href="(#References)">Krizhevsky et al. (2012)</a> indicate performance improvement upon increase in depth.</p>
<p>Still, how many layers are necessary to well approximate a function? In reality, the absolute number of layers is not the important factor, rather how many of these are necessary to effectively represent the target function, denominated as the <em>compact representation</em>. Moreover, if a configuration is smaller than the compact representation, that can pose a predicament to performance, as <a href="(#References)">Bengio (2009, pg. 9)</a> describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More precisely, functions that can be compactly represented by a depth $k$ architecture might require an exponential number of computational elements to be represented by a depth $k-1$ architecture. Since the number of computational elements one can afford depends on the number of training examples available to tune or select them, the consequences are not just computational but also statistical: poor generalization may be expected when using an insufficiently deep architecture for representing some functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be illustrated by the work of <a href="(#References)">Håstad (1986)</a>, awarded the Gödel Prize of 1994. Analogously, the author claims that logic architecture with a limited in-depth presents an exponential number of components in comparison with a deep counterpart. Consider the calculation of the parity function, defined as:</p>
<p>$$f:\{0,1\}^{n}\rightarrow\{0,1\},\thinspace f(x)=\left(\overset{|x]}{\underset{i=1}{\sum}}x_{i}\right) mod\space 2$$</p>
<p>The number of logical components for a depth-limited architecture of 2 layers and $N$ inputs is of in order of $O(2^{N})$. On the other hand, unbounded architectures can produce less complex systems, such as the balanced tree structure of complexity $O(N\thinspace log\thinspace N)$.</p>
<img src="./figures/logic_circuits.png" width="80%"/>
<p style="font-size:0.8em;" align="center">Distinct architectures to compute the parity function. A Disjunctive normal form structure (left) with complexity of $2^{N-1}$ and a balanced tree structure (right) with 5 layers and complexity of $O(N\thinspace log\thinspace N)$.</p>
<p>So, ideally, a function requires a number of layers to be represented in an efficient manner. However, in theory, that does not imply any counterpoints to stacks of layers greater than required by the function, as the spare layers could simply replicate the last compact representation output. However, many challenges arise as the depth of networks increase.</p>

<hr>
<p>Despite the remarked capacity, deep architectures were not widely researched in the past as today. The reasons for this may encompass the former contemptuous view of researchers on this topic, or an insufficient computational power especially compared to contemporary standards. This, however, will not be covered in this series. The challenges of employing such architectures were also imposed by the difficulty in training neural networks with more than two layers, ultimately delivering poor generalization (<a href="#References">Bengio et al. (2007)</a>)<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In the next series of posts I cover some of the predicaments that have followed the development of deep learning, starting from <a href="../saturation">saturation</a>.</p>

<a href="#References">Bengio (2009, pg. 24)</a> appropriately points out that Convolutional Neural Networks with up to seven layers did not suffer as other types of models. This may be due to what the author denominates as a Topographic Structure, suggesting that each neuron in a layer is associated with a small portion of the input. From this, two favorable aspects are hypothesized: the gradient is propagated less diffusely and this hierarchical local connectivity structure may be more suited for image recognition tasks, which is the most common use for such architecture.
